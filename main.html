<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>I want to become a developer because Iâ€™m passionate about creating solutions that make life easier, smarter, and more connected. I enjoy the challenge of solving real-world problems through code and seeing ideas come to life in the form of websites, apps, or software tools.</p>
